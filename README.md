# ECHO — Speech You Can Feel

A real-time speech-to-haptic communication system for Deaf-Blind users utiizing the Advannce Braille Technique. ECHO listens to spoken
language, understands its meaning (not just its words), and encodes that meaning into tactile
feedback the user can feel directly — no interpreter, no lag, no dependence on an round the clock 
active internet connection to work.

## Overview

Pipeline:

```
Microphone → Whisper (speech-to-text) → text normalization → Edge Sentence classifier → Edge AI is confident about its inference -> haptic encoding
                                                                      ↓
                                                      Edge AI is unsure of its inference
                                                                      ↓
                                             AI sends collected data for cloud Inference by Llama AI Instance
                                                                      ↓
                                                Arduino Uno Q Edge Device receives Inference results
                                                                      ↓
                                                               haptic encoding
```

The classifier splits every sentence into four independent signals a haptic device can act on:

| Signal | Values |
|---|---|
| **Intent** | `alert`, `question`, `request`, `statement` |
| **Subject** | `me`, `you`, `other` |
| **Action** | `communicate`, `danger`, `do`, `feel`, `move`, `need` |
| **Concept** | a fixed vocabulary of everyday objects/places/feelings, plus `none` and `unknown_concept` |

Example: `"Turn left."` → `request | you | move | left`

When the edge model isn't confident, the system escalates through a cascade rather than guessing:

```
               Edge CNN (instant, on-device)
                            ↓
 On-device LLM via GenieX + Hexagon NPU (still fully offline)
                            ↓
Cloud LLM (rare, last resort — only if the first two both fail)
```

This matters specifically because it's an assistive device: a confident wrong answer is worse
than an honest "I'm not sure," and a communication aid someone depends on daily can't stop
working just because the Wi-Fi does.

---

## How It Works

1. **Whisper** transcribes speech to raw text.
2. **Text normalization** cleans casual/contraction-heavy speech (see `clean_sentence()` in
   `trainmodel_cnn.py`).
3. **The edge model** — a multi-head Text-CNN (not an LSTM; see [The Edge Model](#the-edge-model)
   for why) — predicts all four signals in one pass, each with its own confidence score.
4. **Confidence gating** — if `min(intent_conf, subject_conf, action_conf, concept_conf)` falls
   below a threshold, the sentence is escalated.
5. **Escalation cascade** — first to an on-device LLM (GenieX, running on the Hexagon NPU, still
   fully offline), and only as a last resort to a cloud LLM.
6. **Haptic encoding** — the final four-field output is mapped to a tactile 3×2 matrix pattern and 3 quick inference tactile.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Surianubhav/ECHO_haptics_for_deafblind.git
cd <TODO: repo name>

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt   # TODO: this file doesn't exist yet — generate one
                                   # (pandas, numpy, tensorflow, scikit-learn, tf2onnx, requests,
                                   #  python-dotenv are all used somewhere in this repo)

# 3. Generate the dataset (optional — pre-built CSVs are already committed)
cd generator_source
python3 main.py
python3 challenge_gen.py
python3 validate_and_report.py

# 4. Train the edge model
cd ..
python3 trainmodel_cnn.py
```

> ✏️ **TODO:** Add instructions for running the full live pipeline (microphone → Whisper →
> model → haptic output) once that integration script exists — this README currently only
> covers the dataset/model/fallback pieces built so far.

---

## The Edge Model

A multi-head **Text-CNN** (parallel `Conv1D` branches at kernel sizes 2/3/4 + global max-pooling,
feeding four independent softmax heads) — deliberately **not** an LSTM.

Why: Whisper hands the model a complete utterance at once, so there's no task reason to pay for
recurrence. LSTM's per-timestep dependency chain doesn't parallelize onto NPU matrix hardware the
way convolution does, and Qualcomm's QNN toolchain has first-class support for exactly this kind
of architecture. Exported to ONNX (`tf2onnx`) for deployment via Qualcomm's QNN runtime.

> ✏️ **TODO:** Once you have a full training run's real numbers, replace this paragraph with
> actual accuracy/loss per head, and a confusion-matrix or per-class breakdown if you have one:
>
> - Action accuracy: `96%`

---

## Fallback Options

Four interchangeable fallback clients are included, all speaking the same
`intent | subject | action | concept` output format behind one OpenAI-compatible request shape —
swapping between them is a config change, not a rewrite:

| File | Backend | Runs where | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cloud_fallback.py` | Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 (Cirrascale) | Cloud | Hackathon-provided; subject to shared-capacity limits |
| `cloud_fallback_grok.py` | xAI Grok | Cloud | Paid, but fast and reliable infra |
| `local_ollama_fallback.py` | Ollama | Local (CPU only on ARM64) | No NPU acceleration currently |
| `local_geniex_fallback.py` | GenieX + Qualcomm AI Hub | Local (NPU-accelerated) | **Recommended** — fully offline, uses the Hexagon NPU |

> ✏️ **TODO:** Decide which of these ships in your final demo and delete/archive the others (or
> keep all four and just say so here) — right now the README presents them as equally live
> options, which may not match what you actually run on stage.

Required environment variables (`.env`), depending on which client you use:

```
# Cirrascale / Qualcomm Cloud AI 100
AI100_API_KEY=<TODO: your key — rotate if it's ever been pasted anywhere>
AI100_API_URL=https://aisuite.cirrascale.com/apis/v2/chat/completions
AI100_MODEL=Llama-3.1-8B

# xAI Grok (alternative)
GROK_API_KEY=<TODO: your key>

# Ollama / GenieX — no API key needed, both default to localhost
```

> ⚠️ Never commit a real `.env` file or paste real API keys into docs, commits, or issues.

## Deploying to Snapdragon Hardware

- **Laptop (Snapdragon X Elite, Windows ARM64):** install [GenieX](https://github.com/qualcomm/GenieX),
  then:
  ```
  geniex pull ai-hub-models/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
  geniex serve
  ```
  This serves an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://127.0.0.1:18181/v1` that `local_geniex_fallback.py`
  talks to directly.
- **Phone (Snapdragon 8 Elite, Android):** GenieX also ships a Java/Kotlin SDK for in-app,
  in-process inference — no local HTTP server needed. See `qualcomm/ai-hub-apps` on GitHub for a
  working reference Android app.

> ✏️ **TODO:** This is the part of the project furthest from done — add real setup notes once
> you've actually gotten the Android integration running (what you had to change, what broke,
> what model you ended up using on-phone).

---

## Known Limitations & Status

- Unavailability of Real User dataset to train on device AI for personalisation.
- Availability of Internet Connectivity for fallback Support.
- Android/phone integration is not yet implemented.
